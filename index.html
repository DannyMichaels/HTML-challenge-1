          You'll never know how much content might be on a page - so, HTML documents are designed to wrap text like this
          - by default. This way, the text can fill up 100% width of the screen - and if the screen changes size, it
          will adjust.
          </br>
          </br>
          It's also a time where you need some "padding" so that it doesn't mash against the side of the screen.
          <br /><br />
          There are many ways to create this padding - but some of them are much more brittle than others.

          When viewing a document on a larger screen, you have much more room! However, it's not enjoyable to read text
          that is too long. people generaly like to read lines with lengths in between 50 and 70 characters. this is
          especially true with our increasingly short attention spans. Are these lines a good width?

          will adjust. BUT because the "window" of the browser can theoretically go on forever... designers often use a
          "wrapper" or some "constraint" type element to limit the width and end up creating this "inner-column" type
          design pattern.

          using as few elements as possible, how might you achieve this layout?
